A basic program which allows you to write into a designated text file with timestamps.

You need to edit directory and filename in `dict_strings` beforehand for the program to work for your needs. 

`path_dir`: directory path (`.` for the current directory)  
`name_filename`: filename

Default file path is `Other/myLogs.txt` for my own use. You can also enable editing of the directory and filename fields if need be.
