CHANGELOG:

            1.5      Config file path dependent on OS (~/Documents/logrecorder & ~/.config/logrecorder).
                     One path variable instead of a path and a filename.
                     Fix? GUI input not outputting a newline to logs file
                     Initialise the program with config file creation and always read path from there.
                     Styling to CLI: a space after indicator, version number after title and a newline after version.
                     Functionality broken in 1.4 should return here.
            1.4.1    Colourful messages groundwork.

            1.3      Ability to delete configuration file & config path to ~/.config/logrecorder
            1.2      Makefile to be able to install the program.
